# Ecommence_backend
This project is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and mongoose to interact with a MongoDb database. This application displays creation of database using mongoDb with models and associations. Then demonstrates the API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through videos.
